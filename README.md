# Project Description: Text-Based Adventure Game:
In this project, I developed a text-based adventure game where players navigate through **a series of choices, challenges, and storylines to reach different outcomes.** This project helped me to demonstrate my ability to **handle user input, manage game state, and create an engaging interactive experience.**


# How to play this Text_Based_Adventure_Game is given below:
This game gives the player a simple choice of 
**a. going left, 
b. going right, or 
c. quitting the game. **
Depending on the choice made, 
the game responds with different outcomes.


# Outcome and Impact:
The completed text-based adventure game provided players with an immersive and entertaining experience while demonstrating my proficiency in C programming, algorithm design, and software architecture. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also highlighted my ability to create complex and engaging user interfaces using minimalistic command-line interactions.
