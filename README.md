# Project Description: Text-Based Adventure Game:
In this project, I developed a text-based adventure game where players navigate through **a series of choices, challenges, and storylines to reach different outcomes.** This project helped me to demonstrate my ability to **handle user input, manage game state, and create an engaging interactive experience.**

This game gives the player a simple choice of 
a. going left,
